Q. What is a key benefit of Google Cloud's Managed Service for Apache Kafka?
Answer: Managed Service for Apache Kafka handles the heavy lifting of operational tasks, such as:
- Sizing: scaling the brokers to meet demand
- Rebalancing: redistributing partitions across the cluster to ensure even load distribution. 
This allows developers to focus on building their applications rather than managing the underlying infrastructure.

Q. Google Cloud Pub/Sub provides native support for exactly-once message processing without requiring additional idempotent logic in the subscriber application.
Options: True, False
Answer: False
Explanation: While Pub/Sub offers "at-least-once" delivery and features like ordering keys and custom message IDs for deduplication, achieving true exactly-once processing typically still requires the subscriber to implement idempotent logic to handle potential duplicate deliveries. Managed Service for Apache Kafka, with configuration, can provide exactly-once processing guarantees.

Advantages of Pub/Sub:
- It is a fully managed, "no-ops" service that simplifies operations by removing the need for cluster management.
- It is completely serverless and offers a pay-for-what-you-use pricing model.
- It automatically integrates with a wide range of Google Cloud services without the need for additional connectors.
Cons of Pub/Sub:
- It does not guarantee strict message ordering across all messages within a topic without affecting throughput.
- It does not provide long-term message persistence, not allowing consumers to replay data from any historical offset.
